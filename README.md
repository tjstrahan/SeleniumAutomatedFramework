# Selenium Automated Framework
A framework built from scratch which uses Maven, Jenkins, Log4j, TestNG, Page object pattern and Extent reports to run Selenium test cases.


This framework will be reusable for lots of different Selenium WebDriver projects and can be run from command line as it is integrated with Maven
and will also allow user to take advantage of power of TestNG whilst automating testing on QAClickAcademy site.

It uses Log4j to provide comprehensive debugging information and is based on the page object pattern to optimize code re-usability, clarity and maintainability. 

It also provides extent reporting facility to give a quick, easy to understand graphical guide to percentage of failing and passing tests.

It is heavily commented throughout as it reflects a learning journey I undertook as part of Selenium Udemy course. Therefore it would also be 
ideal for automated testers new to Selenium WebDriver.
